At this point we are almost done with the body, we only need to start closing the bottom.

I've worked BLO (back loop only) to simulate the border of the shell, but you can do normal stitches.  

- 14: BLO sc 42 [42]
- 15: (dec 1, sc 5) x 6 [36]
- 16: (dec 1, sc 4) x 6 [30]

## Claw:
Make two
The claw is composed of three parts, the first one will be bigger (PT1), then there is a similar but smaller part (PT2) and the "arm" to link the chela to the body (PT3).

### PT1 From the tip
- Round 1: Sc 4 in a magic ring [4]
- 2: inc 1, sc 4 [5]
- 3: inc 1, sc 5 [6]
- 4: inc 1, inc 1, sc 4 [8]
- 5: sc 2, dec 1, sc 2, dec 1 [6]
- 6: sc 1, dec 1, sc 1, dec 1 [4]

Leave a tail for sewing with the other parts

### PT2 From the base
- Round 1: Sc 4 in magic ring [4]
- 2: sc 4 [4]
- 3: dec 1, dec 1 [2]

Close trying to make the end pointy

### PT3
- Round 1: sc 4 in a magic ring [4]
- 2 - 4: sc 4 [4]

![claw and arm pieces](/images/claw_arm_pieces.jpg)

Leave a long tail for sewing

### Assembly
Sew PT2 to the side of PT1, it should end up looking like a "thumb"

Sew PT3 to the base of PT1

## Legs
Make four

- Round 1: sc 4 in a magic ring [4]
- 2 - 5: sc 4 [4]
- 6: dec 1, dec 1 [2]
- Leave a long tail, pass it trough the leg and use it to sew it to the body

## Spikes
Pass the yarn through the central point on the side of the body where you want to

start the spikes.

- chain 5
- slip stitch 1
- stitch 1
- half double crochet 1

This will create a spike
now slip stich 1 through the crab body to fix the spike and repeat

- chain 5
- slip stitch 1
- stitch 1
- half double crochet 1

slip stich 1 through the crab body to fix the spike and go until you cover the whole

body side to side (with the yarn I used it took five spike)


## Eyes
For the eyes I've made two circles out of black felt and sew them to the body.
An alternative could be using black yarn and making a magic ring of 4 or even safety eyes.

## Mouth
Shape the mouth with a needle and black yarn to give your preferred smirk to Ferris!
